# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for improving the existing Academic AI Paper Search application. The current application is a Flask-based web tool that searches multiple academic databases with AI-powered query generation. The improvements focus on code quality, performance, user experience, and adding missing backend functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Code Quality and Maintainability

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining this codebase, I want clean, well-structured code so that I can easily understand, modify, and extend the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the proxy setup code is reviewed THEN the system SHALL remove all repetitive commented code blocks
2. WHEN the Flask application is structured THEN the system SHALL organize code into logical modules and functions
3. WHEN error handling is implemented THEN the system SHALL provide consistent error responses across all endpoints
4. WHEN the code is documented THEN the system SHALL include proper docstrings and comments for all functions

### Requirement 2: Backend API Implementation

**User Story:** As a user of the application, I want the AI-powered features to work correctly so that I can get enhanced search results and summaries.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enables AI search THEN the system SHALL provide working Ollama integration endpoints
2. WHEN query refinement is requested THEN the system SHALL implement `/api/ollama-refine-query` endpoint
3. WHEN abstract summarization is requested THEN the system SHALL implement `/api/ollama-summarize-abstract` endpoint
4. WHEN Ollama is unavailable THEN the system SHALL gracefully fallback to basic functionality

### Requirement 3: Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As a user searching for papers, I want fast and responsive search results so that I can efficiently find relevant research.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple databases are searched THEN the system SHALL implement concurrent/parallel processing
2. WHEN large files are uploaded THEN the system SHALL process them efficiently without blocking the UI
3. WHEN search results are displayed THEN the system SHALL implement pagination for large result sets
4. WHEN the same query is repeated THEN the system SHALL implement basic caching mechanisms

### Requirement 4: Enhanced User Experience

**User Story:** As a researcher using this tool, I want an intuitive and feature-rich interface so that I can effectively discover and analyze academic papers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN search results are displayed THEN the system SHALL show loading states and progress indicators
2. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages with suggested actions
3. WHEN files are processed THEN the system SHALL show processing progress and status
4. WHEN search queries are generated THEN the system SHALL allow users to edit and customize AI-generated queries

### Requirement 5: Robust Error Handling and Logging

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive error handling and logging so that I can monitor and troubleshoot the application effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any API call fails THEN the system SHALL log the error with appropriate detail level
2. WHEN external services are unavailable THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful fallback behavior
3. WHEN file processing fails THEN the system SHALL inform the user and continue with other operations
4. WHEN database searches fail THEN the system SHALL continue searching other available databases

### Requirement 6: Configuration and Environment Management

**User Story:** As a developer deploying this application, I want proper configuration management so that I can easily set up and maintain different environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL load configuration from environment variables
2. WHEN API keys are required THEN the system SHALL validate their presence and format
3. WHEN different environments are used THEN the system SHALL support development, testing, and production configurations
4. WHEN external services are configured THEN the system SHALL validate connectivity on startup

### Requirement 7: Enhanced Search Features

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want advanced search capabilities so that I can find more relevant and specific research papers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN search results are returned THEN the system SHALL implement improved relevance scoring
2. WHEN duplicate papers are found THEN the system SHALL deduplicate results across databases
3. WHEN search filters are applied THEN the system SHALL support more granular filtering options
4. WHEN search history is needed THEN the system SHALL maintain a session-based search history
